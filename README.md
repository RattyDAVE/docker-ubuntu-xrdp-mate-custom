```
docker run --name RattyDAVE20.04 \
           --privileged=true \
           -p 3389:3389 \
           -e TZ="Europe/London"
           -v %LOCAL_PATH_TO_CREATEUSERS.TXT_FILE%:/root/createusers.txt \
           -v %LOCAL_PATH_TO_STARTUP.SH_FILE%:/root/startup.sh \
           -v %LOCAL_PATH_TO_HOME_DIRECTORY%:/home \
           -dit --restart unless-stopped \
           rattydave/docker-ubuntu-xrdp-mate-custom:20.04
```

- Replace %LOCAL_PATH_TO_CREATEUSERS.TXT_FILE% with the local filename of the createusers file.
- Replace %LOCAL_PATH_TO_STARTUP.SH_FILE% with the local filename of the startup.sh script. This is run after the user creation and before the service start.
- Replace %LOCAL_PATH_TO_HOME_DIRECTORY% with the local directory of the /home directorys.

This file contains 3 fields (username:password:is_sudo). Where username is the login id. Password is the password. is_sudo does the user have sudo access(only Y is recognised). It also needs a "newline" at the end of the line.  

Example of a CREATEUSERS.TXT file
```
mickey:mouse:N
daisy:duke:Y
dog:flash:n
morty:rick:wubba
```
In this example 4 users will be created and only daisy will have sudo rights.
At every reboot it will check this file and ADD any new users.

Example of a STARTUP.SH file to change locale.
```
apt-get update
apt-get -y install language-pack-de language-pack-gnome-de
locale-gen de_DE.UTF-8
update-locale LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
```

## To Connect
Please note some clients need an extra parameter set glyph-cache. xfreerdp, remmina and others need this set.

Linux example of how to connect:

```
xfreerdp /size:1920x1140 /kbd:0x00000809 /v:%IP_ADDRESS% /gdi:hw /drive:home,$HOME +clipboard /sound:sys:alsa +glyph-cache
```

Windows example:

Open a command prompt and type

```
mstsc
````

Then put in the ip address of the docker host.

- netbeans
- dia
- geany
- putty
- mysql-workbench
- remmina 
- openjdk-11-jre

Screen sharing:
           On the master user connect using the Xvnc option and login as normal.
           On the desktop there is a file called session_info.txt this will contain the display number and password.
           
           On the other clients connect using the Reconnect option.
           Using the information in the session_info file:
                PORT = 5900 + display number. (So if display is 11 then the port would be 5911)
                USERNAME = Username of the master account.
                PASSWORD = the password in the Session_info.txt file. (e.g. 1a2b3c4d)
                

Example of a working command line.

```
docker run --name RattyDAVE20.04-tools \
           --privileged=true \
           -p 3389:3389 \
           -e TZ="Europe/London"
           -v %LOCAL_PATH_TO_CREATEUSERS.TXT_FILE%:/root/createusers.txt \
           -v %LOCAL_PATH_TO_STARTUP.SH_FILE%:/root/startup.sh \
           -v %LOCAL_PATH_TO_HOME_DIRECTORY%:/home \
           -dit --restart unless-stopped \
           rattydave/docker-ubuntu-xrdp-mate-custom:20.04-tools
```

Please note some clients need an extra parameter set glyph-cache. xfreerdp, remmina and others need this set.

Linux example of how to connect ```xfreerdp /v:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx /drive:home,/home/xxxx +clipboard +glyph-cache```
